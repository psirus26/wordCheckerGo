# wordCheckerGo
Small progam that checks that the sentences entered by the user do not contain forbidden words.

1. Once prompted, type the name of the file that contains the dictionary of taboo words. In our example, the file name is _forbidden_words.txt_
2. Enter a sentence to see if it contains a taboo word
3. Each word of the sentence is broke up, one word per line
4. If it does, the program replaces the taboo word with a number of * based on its number of characters. For instance, "bad" becomes *** and "terrible" becomes ********
5. To leave the program, type 'exit'
